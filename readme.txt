I pretty much only consulted the slides and campuswire
Everything finds the correct path except for Greedy-h1 and Greedy-h2. Aside from that A* frontier and expanded numbers
are a little off from the example in class. I really thought my Greedy algorithm was correct as I walked it through
shorter length problems. It is also odd that it only performs correctly with h3 as h3 is directly based on h2
with a small tweak.
